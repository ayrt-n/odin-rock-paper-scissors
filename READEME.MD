Project for The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/):

- Created empty website which prompts users to play a best of five game of rock, paper, scissors versus the computer (randomly generated response)

- The results of individual games are printed to the console, along with the winner of the best of five

- Project utilizes javascript

Updated on Octover 14, 2021:

- Added UI to rock paper scissors, using html and css

- UI utilizes JS and the DOM to display the results as the game is played
